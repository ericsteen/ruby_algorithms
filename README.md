# RubyAlgorithms

A collection of practical and questionably impractical data structures &
algorithms in Ruby with benchmarks allowing the algorithmist to compare and
contrast various algorithmic techniques.

## Done:

### Algorithms:

Fibonacci

Factorial

Coin Change

Kadane's Max Subarray Algorithm

Singly Linked List

Generalized BST

Generalized Graph

Probability Space

Queue

Adjacency List (sparse graphs)

Adjacency Matrix (non-sparse graphs)

Searching

String Similarity

Priority Queue

Heap

BFS

DFS

## Todo:


### Data Structures:

Doubly Linked List

ADT API for Advanced Data Structures

DiGraph

BiPartite graphs

### Algorithms:

String Pattern Matching (Naive, Rubin-Karp, KNP)

Shortest Paths (Djikstra, A*)

Knapsack

Multi-Armed Bandit

Decision Tree Learning

Markov Decision Processes

Cycle Detection

Connected Components

Metropolis-Hastings

Sorting

Primes


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'ruby_algorithms'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install ruby_algorithms

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
